      <h2>Meet Melissa</h2>

      <p>
        For over two decades, I’ve worked with leaders in boardrooms, training rooms, and quiet one-on-one
        conversations, often carrying the same question: How do I trust myself as much as others trust me?
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve built learning and development strategies inside real organizations, coached senior leaders through moments
        of high visibility and internal doubt, and designed programs that turn complexity into clarity and confidence
        into embodied skill.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t teach confidence as a personality trait or a performance. I teach it as something that can be learned,
        practiced, and returned to, especially when the stakes are high.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is grounded in psychology, shaped by experience, and built for people who no longer need to prove
        they’re capable but who want to feel as steady inside as they appear on the outside.

<!-- THE APPROACH -->
<section id="approach" class="section approach-section">

      <h2>The Approach</h2>

      <p class="approach-lead">
        This work supports individual contributors, leaders, teams, and organizations through coaching, training, consulting, and speaking, all grounded in one core principle:
      </p>

     <p class="approach-highlight">
         Clarity builds confidence. <strong>And confidence changes how people lead, communicate, and decide.</strong>
     </p>


      <p>
        Whether we’re working one-on-one, in a leadership room, on a stage, or inside an organization, the focus is always the same:
        helping people move from complexity to clarity and from uncertainty to confident action.
      </p>

      <p>
        This work is for leaders who no longer need to prove they’re capable,
        but want to stop editing themselves mid-sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s for individuals and teams navigating real responsibility:
        high-stakes decisions, visible moments, and internal pressure that doesn’t always get talked about.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RIGHT COLUMN -->
    <div class="approach-block approach-alt">
      <h2>What This Work Is Not</h2>

      <ul class="approach-list">
        <li>Not hype, performative confidence, or borrowed charisma.</li>
        <li>Not “fake it till you make it.”</li>
        <li>Not short-term motivation that fades by Monday.</li>
        <li>Not therapy and not a quick fix.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This work is quiet, internal, and structural.  
        It restores the connection between what you know and how you show up.
      </p>

      <p class="approach-manifesto">
        Presence over performance.<br>
        Clarity over charisma.<br>
        Confidence that holds under pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re looking for surface-level tactics, this isn’t it.  
        But if you’re ready to lead with steadiness, intention, and self-trust;  
        you’re in the right place.
